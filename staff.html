              <p><span>“Success isn’t about how much money you make, it’s about the difference you make in people’s lives.”-Michelle Obama</span></p>
              <p>Annette Foster holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Education and an endorsement in Special Education from Creighton University in Omaha. She also has a Master of Science degree in Reading from the University of Nebraska at Omaha. She has worked for the Omaha Public School system as an elementary and middle school teacher for 35 years until her retirement in the spring of 2014. Annette has taught undergraduate and graduate students, managed after school tutoring programs, designed and written various curriculum and programs and has been a member of numerous educational committees. Along with her daughter, Antoinette Davis, Annette is co-founder of Power of Words Literacy. Part of its mission is to encourage reading, so Power of Words co-hosts literacy fairs with various schools which include games, crafts and free books at no cost to participants.</p>
              <p>Annette’s mission is to inspire her students to be the best they can be in all areas of their lives. She believes every student is unique and has a purpose. She encourages them to explore their talents and interests. She anticipates their needs and keeps them actively engaged in their own learning by using various assessments as tools followed by best practices in education. She believes educators teach more than subjects and concepts, they teach the whole person. She holds her students to high expectations and they know in no uncertain terms that she expects them to achieve. In response to why she is excited to teach the students at Nelson Mandela Elementary she states, “The reward in teaching is the satisfaction of knowing that I make a difference. When I teach, I have the joy of knowing that I was a part of inspiring a generation of teachers, doctors, lawyers, athletes and others. I may never see the end result of my teaching in a student’s life, but I know that I’ve played a part in planting the seeds.”</p>

              <p>My name is Jenae Hines and have two children, James Ray Anthony and Julia RayAnn. I am the oldest of four on my mother’s side and second oldest of four on my father’s side. My hobbies are arts and crafts, spending time outdoors, and singing. Crafts give me an escape where I get a chance to free my mind and create. I enjoy the outdoors over the summer and visit the zoo almost once a week. I really enjoy singing and have performed at a number of different places since I was little. I have a big heart and always want to help in any way that I can. I love working with kids; I truly believe it’s my calling.</p>
              <p>In 2008 I graduated from Omaha South High School and went on to study nursing at Iowa Western Community College. After working as a CNA for OPS, I soon realized nursing was not where I wanted to start my career. I stayed with OPS until April 2015. Though I couldn’t see where I was going at times, I believe my life was headed in a new direction and I think it is safe to say the storm is over for now! I am thankful for the sister I have found in Mrs. Maxwell, fellow Mandela instructor, and for Dr. Toohey for giving me the opportunity to be part of such an amazing establishment.</p>

She is passionate about inspiring and motivating children to be better than their circumstances. Maxwell states, “Many people will judge you based upon where you live. Majority of these students have no control over that area in life. They can show the world how intelligent they are while upholding respect, nobility, and grandeur about themselves. You may be in your habitat but you do not have to be a product of your domain if your environment is not conducive to your success.” As Nelson Mandela said, “Do not judge me by my successes, judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again.”</p>

              <p>Peg Wurtz was born in Philadelphia, raised in West Des Moines and has been in Omaha since college. She graduated from Creighton University in 1988 and will be bringing a wide range of teaching experiences and training to Nelson Mandela Elementary. She has taught summer school and substituted at Boys Town.</p>
              <p>While teaching kindergarten at St. Agnes, Peg saw a need for the older girls to have an opportunity to be involved in athletics. This inspired her to start their basketball program. Following her time at St. Agnes, Peg moved to Millard to help launch a new curriculum program where she both developed and taught the curriculum. After staying home to raise her three children, Peg taught 1st and 2nd grades at Sacred Heart.</p>
              <p>When Peg read about Nelson Mandela Elementary, the curriculum it had chosen, the opportunity the students were going to have and the impact on the community, Peg could not resist getting involved. She states, “I know and love this curriculum! I have seen it work. I cannot wait to be a part of something that is going to make such a huge difference in the lives of our students. There will be a great many success stories at Nelson Mandela and I’m excited to be a part of that!”</p>
